        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        An economy is a complex system of interrelated production, consumption, and exchange activities that ultimately determines how resources are allocated among all the participants. The production, consumption, and distribution of goods and services combine to fulfill the needs of those living and operating within the economy.

    </p>
    <h2>Types of Economies</h2>
    <ol><h3><li>Studying Economies</li></h3>
        <p>
            The study of economies and the factors affecting economies is called economics. The discipline of economics can be broken into two major areas of focus, microeconomics, and macroeconomics.

        </p>
        <h3><li>Macroeconomics</li></h3>
        <p>
            Macroeconomics includes the study of economy-wide factors such as the effect of rising prices or inflation on the economy. It seeks to track and understand the financial indicators that clarify an economy's success or failure over time, such as gross domestic product (GDP), changes in unemployment, and consumer spending.

        </p>
        <h3><li>Economic Indicators</li></h3>
        <p>As noted above, macroeconomics is the study of the big picture and that picture is incomplete without a set of economic indicators. These are some of the most closely-watched of those indicators.
