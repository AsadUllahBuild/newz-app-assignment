        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Climate characterizes the average weather conditions for a particular location over a long period of time. WMO actively coordinates the study of the climate, its variations, extremes and change over the past, present and the future. In close collaboration with user agencies, WMO also supports the study of climate impacts on a variety of socio-economic sectors to support evidence-based decision-making on how to best to manage the risks of climate variability and adapt to a changing climate, to ensure human safety and well-being.

    <h2>Types Of Climate</h2><hr>
    <ol><h3><li>Global Seasonal Climate Update</li></h3>

        <p>The WMO Global Seasonal Climate Update (GSCU), issued quarterly, summarizes the current status (monitoring) and the expected future behaviour (prediction) of the global seasonal climate focusing on the major general circulation features and large‐scale oceanic anomalies around the globe (e.g., El Niño/Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, etc.) and their potential impacts on the worldwide surface temperature and precipitation patterns.

        </p>
        <h3><li>Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update</li></h3>

        <p>The WMO Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update (GADCU), issued annually in May, summarizes the predicted future of the global climate over the next year and the next five years. The focus is on climate indices such as global mean near-surface temperature, Atlantic multidecadal variability and the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, as well as regional indices and annual and multi-year seasonal means of near-surface temperature, mean sea-level pressure and precipitation. Maps of prediction skill are available to help with interpretation. A short summary of the observed global climate over the past five years is also included, to provide the current climate context.

        <p>Regional Climate Outlook Forums (RCOFs) produce consensus-based, user-relevant climate outlook products in real time in order to reduce climate-related risks and support sustainable development for the coming season in sectors of critical socioeconomic significance for the region in question.
