        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        The definition of health science is the study of the well-being, health, or medical care for human beings or those who are sick or unhealthy. Those who study and work in the health sciences field learn skills and fundamentals for taking care of people in a wide range of medical specialties.

    <ol><h3><li>Attainment of Knowledge Through the Health Sciences</li></h3>
        <p>Knowledge related to health science is mainly acquired through research studies. These studies may include such things as evaluating new medications and treatments to ensure they are both effective and safe. The development of antibiotics and vaccines for major diseases are a few examples of the benefits that have come from preclinical research. This type of research involves the creation of new approaches to therapy and treatment. Health science also includes research related to diet, nutrition, and fitness.

        <h3><li>Health Science Major</li></h3>
        <p>A bachelor's degree with a major in health science prepares students for a variety of careers in health science and health care. Generally, programs include both classroom lectures and hands-on learning, such as lab work, in order to most effectively prepare graduates for the field. Coursework may include biology, physiology, environmental health, health informatics, among others. Although not the case in every program, some students may be required to complete an internship or practicum prior to graduation. This may take place in a research facility or health center, such as a hospital.
