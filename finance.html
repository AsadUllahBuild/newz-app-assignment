        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Finance is defined as the management of money and includes activities such as investing, borrowing, lending, budgeting, saving, and forecasting. There are three main types of finance: (1) personal, (2) corporate, and (3) public/government.

    <h2>Types of Finance</h2>
    <ol><h3><li>Stock</li></h3>
        <p>
            When a person owns stock in a company, the individual is called a shareholder and is eligible to claim part of the company’s residual assets and earnings (should the company ever have to dissolve). A shareholder may also be referred to as a stockholder. The terms “stock,” “shares,” and “equity” are used interchangeably in modern financial language. The stock market consists of exchanges where investors can buy and sell individual shares of a company.

        <h3><li>Financial Modeling</li></h3>
        <p>
            Financial modeling is one of the most highly valued, but thinly understood, skills in financial analysis. The objective of financial modeling is to combine accounting, finance, and business metrics to create a forecast of a company’s future results.

            A financial model is simply a spreadsheet which is usually built in Microsoft Excel, that forecasts a business’s financial performance into the future. The forecast is typically based on the company’s historical performance and assumptions about the future, and requires preparing an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and supporting schedules (known as a three-statement model).

        <h3><li>Financial Forecasting</li></h3>
        <p>
            Financial forecasting is the process of estimating or predicting how a business will perform in the future. The most common type of financial forecast is an income statement; however, in a complete financial model, all three financial statements are forecasted. In this guide on how to build a financial forecast, we will complete the income statement model from revenue to operating profit or EBIT.
